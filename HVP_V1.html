    <h2 class="w3-wide">HVP V1</h2>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>OCTOBER 10, 2020</i></p>
    <img src="src/HVP_V1/1.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <p class="w3-justify">This is the first generation of the hyper-velocity printer. A lot of time was spent designing,
      manufacturing, and tuning the printer. Most of the parts were manufactured using the MPCNC. The printer was aimed
      to achieve a considerably high printing speed. However, the printer was eventually disassembled for the second
      generation because of the design flaw on the Z axis.</p>
    <img src="src/HVP_V1/17.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <p class="w3-justify">These are the hardware bought online. I chose a set of SKR V1.3 and raspberry pi as controller
      and actually brought a mosquito hot end from U.S. There's also a set of close-loop controlled NEMA23 stepper
      motors and PCB for stepper driver converting that made by myself.</p>
    <img src="src/HVP_V1/14.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <p class="w3-justify">I made most of the parts by the MPCNC and spent a lot of time optimizing the machining process
      for better quality and shorter manufacturing time. In the picture is the x carriage manufactured by MPCNC.</p>
    <img src="src/HVP_V1/11.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <p class="w3-justify">Most of the printer frame was manufactured with black FR4 fiber glass boards. The FR4 has
      similar property with carbon fiber board but with a much cheaper price and around 30% more weight. Also, the FR4
      is more friendly to manufacture as the dust does no harm and settling much faster than carbon fiber.</p>
    <img src="src/HVP_V1/3.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <p class="w3-justify">Just want to show off the perfect wiring. :) So things in this picture worth sharing are the
      customized PCB boards for stepper driver converting on the top right of the SKR and customized lead screw which is
      different with the previous picture. So the reason of switching to regular lead screw instead of the original ball
      lead screw is the ball lead screw creates a periodic horizontal shift every rotation. And since the tolerance of
      the ball lead screw is much smaller than the regular lead screw, the shift was transferred to the printer bed, and
      it created a periodic layer pattern on the print part.</p>
    <img src="src/HVP_V1/4.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <p class="w3-justify">So I found the problem by using a dial gauge. There was actually some uneven vertical error
      every z move as well as the tolerance on the ball lead screw is so small that it drove the two linear rail
      unevenly. Therefore, after trying several solutions such as adding springs between the leading nut and heat bed as
      the previous picture shows, I found my self more into the 3Z self-leveling design. So the first generation of
      hyper velocity printer was very unfortunately disassembled for its successor.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">After around half a year after I took the printer apart, HevORT on YouTube (MirageC now) post
      a video about the horizontal shift on the ball lead screw. The cool dude designed a quite good solution to the
      problem. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqSQhwqSzvg" target="_blank">Link to YouTube video.</a></p>
